                        <p> You are ten years old.  You live with your mother and your father who are esteem treasure hunters.  They are renowned for their successful finds, their biggest being Montezuma’s Treasure at the bottom of lake Texcoco.  They are truly brilliant, the smartest people you know, they always seem to know where to look to find “the good stuff”.  You aspire to be just like them when you grow older.  They often leave their work piled amongst the many artifacts within your basement.  You often find the basement a mysterious place, full of adventure maps and surprises.</p>
	                           <p> Their latest adventure took them to the coast of Florida looking for the 1715 Spanish Treasure Fleet that was lost due to an ocean storm.  Legend says that gold and riches beyond your wildest dreams await you at the site of the fallen ships.  Some say that the ships sank and are now sitting at the bottom of the ocean.  Others say that the fleet fled, too greedy to share their gold with the rest of the world.  One of the more interesting theories is that the gold was cursed so that any who possess it must forever walk the earth; not even death could stop the sailors from eternal work. </p>
                                <p> Many adventurers criticize your parents for searching for something that can’t be found.  Though they still pressed on, certain that they would be able to find the treasure.  With the money the gained from the last expedition, they set forth on a new adventure.  They promised you that once they get everything settled out there on their boat that you could come and visit.  But before that could happen, they mysteriously went missing.  Not just your parents, but the entire ship and it’s crew just vanished into thin air.  Even the reports couldn’t identify the cause of their absence, they gave some causes as to why they might have disappeared.  It said on the newspaper that the most likely cause of the tragic accident was compass and computer malfunctions. </p>
                                <p>Your Uncle Andy was shocked to here about his brother’s accident.  He never believed that it was the cause of computers and stuff.  He became obsessed with this case, aloof to everything else in the world except you. </p>
                                <p>You’ve been living with your grandparents for the past few months.  They were kind people but you often felt that you were taking care of them and not the other way around.  Uncle Andy often came to visit you and make sure that everything was alright.  Though today he seemed more exciting than usual.</p>
                                <p>“I’ve found it!!!” He proclaimed, barging through the front door. </p>
                                <p> “Found what?” I asked. </p>
                                <p>“A clue, a clue to your parent’s whereabouts!” He sang and he danced, his brown beard hanging low and his round spectacles glaring in the sunlight. </p>
                                <p>“And guess what boy?” he asked, “I’m going to take you with me!  We’ll find ‘em together!”</p>
