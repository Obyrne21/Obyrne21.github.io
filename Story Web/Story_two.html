                        <p>You cautiously process what Uncle Andy just exuberantly claimed.  Could he really mean what he just said? 
                            “When do we start?” you finally reply and grin from ear to ear. </p>

                        <p>“Right now!!!! I know exactly where to find them, all it will take is the two of us, some food, a boat, and dedication.” </p>
                            <p>What have you gotten yourself into?  You begin to question how long this is gonna take.  It will be worth it.  You have to find your parents. </p>
                            <p> “Let’s get it started,” you respond.  You have never been more sure of anything in your life. </p>
                            <p> At this, Uncle Andy begins to pace back and forth, anxious to begin work.  You and Andy then head to the library inside of your grandparents house.  The vintage library was rather spacious with rows and rows of different history books and journal exhibitions and your parents personal adventure stories and pamphlets.  The library was known for sparking excitement and a longing for something greater.    </p>
                            <p> You sit down with your uncle in the welcoming plush armchairs.  The fire crackles and and glows, illuminating your waiting and electrified face as you await your uncle’s evidence. </p>
	                           <p> “Here look at the map,” he said boyountly, brandishing the map in your face.  You look at in disdain, you have already searched over it many times before and found nothing suspicious.  </p>
