                        <h2>Cinema</h2>
                        <p>  The beginning of the filmmaking industry begins during the times of the Great Depression and World War 2.  Films were often propaganda supporting the war or military films in general.  However, some movies provided an entertainment or distraction from all the chaos going around the world, a way to escape.  People were able to get away from reality for a few hours and just forget the struggles of the present.  In addition, people were able to look to the future and see that in time things will get better.  Science fictions were also a virtual reality people were able to be transported to which helped provide them with a sense of hope.  Specifically, Star Wars , Lord of the Rings movies, and the Harry Potter movies were able to define a newer sense of good defeating evil. </p>
                        <p> These escapist tools provided people with a sense of security in hope, the good guys will always win no matter how dark and terrible the chaos is.  Many writers have come to the agreement that people attend movies and blockbusters to escape from the realities of life, this is proven in the data that only two of the top twenty box office hits in 2016 were set in the real world, "Central Intelligence" and "Jason Bourne."  Escapist films have been organized into three categories: fantastical elements, historical, and reality but ignoring modern problems 
                        </p>
                        <p> Personally/collectively, movies have been used to get away for a few hours.  Whether it be to just laugh or be taken to another dimension, cinema is very effective at taking people's brains and transporting them to another reality where they don't have to face the pressures of their daily life.  Movies are a chance to not worry what other people are thinking around you.  They offer relaxation, suspense, happiness, joy, humor.
                        </p>
                        <p> Fictional films are not always used for escapism, a person can choose whatever fits their personality best.  Some love documentaries, others despise those.  With so many genres and different aspects to every single individual movie, everyone is able to find a few that they are able to connect to.
                        </p>
                        <p>  One of the newest movies, Ready Player One, completely envelops the theme of escapism.  The movie shows people of all ages partaking in a video game, the Oasis.  People are playing this to escape their daily lives.  The main community shown is a junk almost trailer park, the people are not very well off at all but still everyone's focus is on the game.  One scene even shows a mom sidetracking her own duties, like dinner, and the scene shows the stove on fire but she pays little attention to her son making that claim.  Society is completely enveloped in the game.  The main character claims people play the game to escape.  They are able to change who they are or act any way they can.  They are able to look exactly how they want and change anything about themselves, making them in a sense their perfect ideal model.  One example is the main character's best friend in the game.  In the Oasis, the best friend seems like a strong touch man but in real life they are a strong female, not what anyone is expecting.  Another scene is very relatable and a wake up call to some people.  The love interest of the main character calls him out for being so evoked in the game that he is neglecting reality.  He is not thinking of what is actually occurring during real time and he is not paying attention to anything but the game.  Ready Player One is a great movie that shows how society is searching to escape.

                        <p> Cinema allows people to forget their worries or troubles.  They can use their imagination and let it chase their wildest dreams of being anything.  Movies are so provoking in many ways.  They spark emotion and questions and conversations.  But most importantly, they allow a person to step out of their own state of mind for a few hours.
