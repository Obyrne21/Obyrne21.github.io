                        <p>The following video was completed by Seth Wilson, Riley O'Byrne, Kylie Dailey, and Evan Ross for their first six week project in American Literature with Mr. Krause.  It discusses escapism and how teenagers are un-safely using illegal alcohol to escape.  </p>
                        <p> Summary: Teenagers use drugs and or alcohol to forget some of their reality and let loose so they don't have the stress or pressures that are tied together with everyday life.
                        </p>
                        <p>Drugs and alcohol are not the inly way people can escape.  Sports are another resource.  Practices and competetions are good ways to just get some easy exercise but also to focus all attention on a specific area.  They are noit affected/influenced by if someone did good on a test or was wearimg the most adorable outfit to school.  It's just about the game.  </p>
                        <p>Professional sports are extremely important too.  The millions of millions of dollars that are spent for the Superbowl or a regular football game is outstanding.  The money people spend to watch men throw and catch and kick a ball is incredible.  It won't affect their lives much at all.  yet people after the Superbowl choose to skip work the next day.  In 2017, there was an estimated 16.5 million people who were willing to call out of work the day after the Superbowl.  Super sick Monday is notoriously the one day that most people call out of work.  People are so sucked up on the game that there tends to be a lot of drinking possibly and people are beyond excited that their team won.  It does not change the overall outcome of their day, they use football as a source of escaping and letting loose.</p>
                        <p>Sports allow us to feel a part of something bigger than ourselves.  If our team is successful, we in turn our successful ourselves.  We prepare for our teams game when we aren't even playing ourselves.  We spend money on merchandise all for teams that compete for a season.  We spend hundreds of dollars for tickets, we stay up late, we yell at coaches, refs, and players for mistakes.  Yet none of it truly will matter in the future.  Sports aren't going to get rid of pain and sorrow.  They are a way to hope for something better and for success.  They are a way to not think about hardships.
                        </p>
                        <p>Kylie's personal story:  I always look forward to volleyball practices and tournaments.  It's a way to just let out every emotion on the court.  if I am angry take it out on the ball, if I am happy just scream and shout when you score.  When I play volleyball, it doesn't matter what I got on a science test or if there is a bunch of drama at school.  Volleyball is a time to just focus on something I love and have fun, not think too hard about life.</p>
                        <p>Sports, drugs, alcohol, and other forms of entertainment are commonly used by everyday people whether they realize it or not as ways to escape.  They are ways for people to create a facade for themselves and not stress about their real lives or deal with hardships.  It's a way to hope for something better.</p>
